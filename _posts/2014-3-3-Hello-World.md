Many engineering students & engineers spend way too much time in asking, which Microcontroller (MCU) would be the best for learning. My suggestion is to pick any and start instead of just asking.
Aim of this article is to give direction to a beginner, how to start, what all topics to cover during learning about microcontrollers.
Before you start learning about microcontrollers, you must gain some basic understanding of Electronics, otherwise, it will be difficult to understand all the concepts and do the programming effectively. Some of the best-embedded design engineers are also good hardware engineers. Please go through the hardware section of this article “What to learn to become a good embedded design engineer”.
Later, go through the overview of Microconroller to gain some theoretical understanding. Some eBooks are available here.
Refer book: The 8051 Microcontroller and Embedded Systems: Using Assembly and C by Muhammad Ali Mazidi (Author) for basic MCU, programming concepts. I have referred the same book during my time in 2003–2005, while I was getting training at Emtech Foundat
